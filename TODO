Local password and email storage:
	The users password and email should be preserved in client memory after logging in, so that when they spawn ROBUST it can create a corresponding OpenSim user. Or we could prompt them again for the password, as long as they don't have to use the terminal.

Catch ROBUST launch errors:
	Check all the output lines (there is a method stub for this) coming from ROBUST and pop up an error message when errors happen. MySQL errors should be the first thing to code catching for.

Detect successful ROBUST launch:
	Just like above, but detect successfull launch and change the status bar. Also this is when the grid icon should turn blue and send out gridHostActive, not when ROBUST starts launching like now.

HTTP POST sender to send commands to running service REST consoles:
	Exactly what it sounds like. A method stub for this exists.

First launch of ROBUST should do initial setup:
	First create a corresponding OpenSim user for the local user. This is why we need to store passwords and emails.
	Also create an estate named "My Estate" and owned by this user.

First launch of region should do initial setup:
	Region will prompt for stuff like estate, owning user, etc... Either respond to these prompts or do some pre-configuration to prevent them.

Moderator functions should only be visible to moderators:
	We are not relying on this for security, but no need to clutter up the interface for non-mods.
