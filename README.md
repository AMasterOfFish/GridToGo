# GridToGo
## An easy to use GUI for creating and managing ad-hoc OpenSim grids.

GridToGo aims to fill the currently empty niche of a simple, self-contained program to create and manage decentralized [OpenSim](http://opensimulator.org/) grids on end-user machines, such as laptops. Lets put OpenSim in the hands of anyone who wants to play with it by removing the traditional reliance on a big complicated grid server, and making as easy as joining a friends game in any modern online video game.

GridToGo runs on any platform that supports Mono 2.10 or .NET 4.0 and is written in C# utilizing the GTK# GUI toolkit.

GridToGo was created by Michael Craft for [Summer At The Edge 2012](http://wbi-icc.com/centers-services/discovery-lab) under the direction of Dr. Rob Williams and is released under the MIT license.
